        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">A single father with his only daughter. Lazarus loved his daughter Isabella to the moon and back, 
            she was the only light he ever needed in his life. A middle-class worker who's continuously working on the 
            construction site to put food on the table; A hardworking father whose only wish is to put a smile on his 
            only child. But the world had other plans, a couple of months before the outbreak Isabella was diagnosed 
            with acute leukemia. When the outbreak finally spread, he arrived at the hospital to quickly get Isabella 
            and was trying to head over to the nearest rescue camp when he bumped into the road with 2 girls 
            trying to run away from the feasters. He quickly helped them and for a while they traveled to find the camp, 
            Isabella was getting worse… One bad night they were hunting for a place to stay when a nearby oil factory 
            went up in flames and attracted the feasters. Isabella snatched one of the fast feasters. And was eaten right 
            in front of everyone. Including Lazarus.

          <h1>Onyx</h1>
          <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">A queer child who constantly looked for acknowledgement from others. 
              Onyx grew up in the rescue camp surrounded by people who always treated him like a slave. He never met 
              his parents and never had someone who showed him what a role model should be. He lingered continuously 
              in the camp and upon reaching a certain age was assigned to help in the kitchen but was continuously 
              bullied by one of the main families in the camp which made him into a stubborn person who always only 
              thought about himself.

          <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Before the outbreak, Abaddon was a sophomore in his community college. 
              Eager to continuously rise above everyone else he became entitled to his work. When the outbreak hit he 
              found a camp and stayed there for a while. But when the camp was run down by one feaster he saw a glimpse 
              of his glory and quickly killed the feaster after the reckless massacre it caused. Since then he became 
              the leader of the camp but never acknowledged the people who were working beside him. All he did was order 
              everyone to what he thought was right, a hot headed tempered man who proposed himself as a good guy.

            A simple girl with a perfect family who supported everything she wanted to achieve and be in life; A person 
            full of love and hope. But when the global outbreak hit, she witnessed how her parents turned into feasters 
            which almost killed her. But then she met River who saved her from being bitten and turning into one of them 
            and since then she found her purpose to continuously move forward.

            was a criminal being hunted by the police before the outbreak happened but when it all broke loose. She fought 
            many feasters before finding the camp and was assigned as the main guard of the facility. But she’s a maniac who 
            always threatens people with her authority. She is very short tempered and easily hurt the person that triggers 
            her rage.

            rebel child that dropped out of school to pursue their passion in music. Eventually, she independently got herself 
            out of that house and frequently played music at many cafes and bars around their area. But she always had her eyes 
            on this one girl who was a regular at the cafe where she usually does her gigs. She never knew her name. But when 
            the outbreak happened, she was able to cross paths with her in the most horrible way ever. Being chased by feasters 
            was it. How romantic.

          <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">A monster that came out of wheat products. Before the outbreak the researchers 
            experimented with different chemicals trying to create a parasite that rapidly helps plants grow. Nothing went 
            wrong during the experimentation, but when the foods were processed it made people sick which quickly turned them 
            into feasters, one bite from any of the ones who turned can turn you into one of them in the span 2 days.
